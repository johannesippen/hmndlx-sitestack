# «Details Make the Experience» – Interview with Frank Rausch

Of all the designers I’ve encountered throughout my career, Frank is probably the most detail-focussed. He designs and codes apps, teaches in design schools all over Europe and complains about people using x instead of × for a close button icon. His actual title is “User Interface Typographer” – a perfect description of what he does.

I first encountered Frank’s work when I leanred about Partly Cloudy, a super-nerdy weather app. The last two years, Frank was working on “V for Wiki” – probably the coolest Wikipedia Reader out there. The app not only has a 5 star rating on the App Store, it also won 2 big design awards and was in the selection of “Best Apps 2016”. How does one get there?

To find out, I needed to speak to Frank. I met him in a café on a busy street in West Berlin, just down the road from David Bowie’s old Berlin apartment. We spoke about details, typographic obsessions and why he doesn’t get inspired by Dribbble.

**Question: Frank, you made an app called “V for Wiki”. Can you tell me a bit about how you made, why made it and what the special thing about it?**

Frank: A couple of years ago, I thought that the ways of reading Wikipedia don’t really do justice to the great content. There was the website, which was kind of dull and hasn’t changed since 2004, there are a couple of first and third party app, which also don’t put the stress on typography. With my agency, we made a Wikipedia Reader app, which was fairly successful, but only as a sideproject.

I decided it would be better to start from scratch and make a great new Wikipedia reader app. Two years ago I decided to go for it. Start from scratch. Build the Wikipedia reader app of my dreams that would work on all iOS devices, including the Apple Watch.
