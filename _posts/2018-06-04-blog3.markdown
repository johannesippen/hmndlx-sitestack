# The IKEA Principle

Guiding users and creating experiences is more than only about fixed routes and agendas. It’s about having people coming to buy a shelf and going home with a dozen of candles and plants – and still not being unhappy.

If we want to look for great experiences, we need to extend our horizon – we need to look in the physical world. Why not learn from the big guys? The ones who have done this for some decades now? During my research, I discovered 7 essential steps in a user journey. They come from an e-commerce world, but they work very well in every situation where a user needs to convert somehow.

The funny thing: They all can be found in the way that Scandinavian interior giant IKEA has tailored their experience. So, let me invite you on a little shopping trip to our favorite Swedish furniture shop.

## Phase 1: Clear the Stage

You park your car, eat a hearty lunch at the shop restaurant, visit the bathroom and sink your kids in the ball pit. Before the actual shopping mapping starts, you clear the stage. You prepare for the next 3 hours full of candles, chairs, and Kötbullar.

In the two-factor theory, hygiene is a factor that helps to prevent unhappiness, without being the central purpose. In other words: I’m not going to IKEA to visit the bathroom, but if I have the chance to, I’m definitely happier.
