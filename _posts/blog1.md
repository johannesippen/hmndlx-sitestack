# Survival Guide for the Attention Economy

If you know me a bit, you know that I never post any political views. I like to grant everyone their own views, even if those aren’t mine or I disagree with them. Mostly because this is how democracy works. What I don’t like though is when people get tricked into spreading political messages they do not agree with, being turned into unknowing multipliers. This way of abusing the attention economy is a dangerous thread for our democracy, and I want you to be aware of that.

How do I come to writing about this? A friend of mine shared a post from a conservative politician two weeks ago, who complained about English-speaking hipsters in Berlin. The politician couldn’t care less about what language you have to order your Flat White in Kreuzberg, but he is using this highly provocative subject to get his name out. My friend, although he disagrees with almost everything this politician stands for, found himself in the Flat-White-story and gave the politician exposure – like many others. Scary, isn’t it?

The question I’m trying to answer is: How can we still have a political discussion around the topics that strive us? How can we avoid giving people that we disagree with exposure? How can we own this discussion?
